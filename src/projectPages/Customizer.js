                <h2>What is it?</h2>
                <p>
                    The MyMiniFactory Customizer is a tool where a 3D designer can make money by selling customisable 3D designs.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I managed the project, designed the user experience for both the 3D designer and customer and also coded some of the UI. I worked with Adrian Delgado, the lead developer for this project.

                <h2>Designing the user experience</h2>
                <p>
                    The user interface for the customer to customise their file is simple. I looked at our competitor, <a href="https://www.heroforge.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Hero Forge</a> and video games character creators for inspiration.
                </p>
                <img 
                    src={require("./../assets/Customizer/HeroForge-resized-min.jpg")}
                    alt="UI of HeroForge"
                />
                <p>
                    But the main challenge of the project was how to design an intuitive system for the 3D designer to upload their designs. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    I spoke to the developer to find out how the project worked technically behind the scenes. From there, I figured out what actions the 3D designer needs to do.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Upload a STL file</li>
                    <li>Tell the customizer which group of parts (part type) it belongs to. So the customer can swap it out for another part from the same group.</li>
                    <li>Tell the customizer where and how the parts join together</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I brainstormed different ways the overall main structure of the Customizer could work. I tested these using paper prototypes with which users can click through. With paper, I can easily iterate and change the prototype quickly even during mid test.
                </p>
                <img 
                    src={require("./../assets/Customizer/UserTest1.jpg")}
                />
                <p>
                    For inputting the position and rotation of where parts joined together I prototyped a few different ways to do that in Unity.
                </p>
                <img src={require("./../assets/Customizer/UnityTest.jpg")}/>
                <p>
                    These were the metrics and considerations of choosing the method of joining parts.

                <h2>Managing the project</h2>
                <p>
                    I joined the project close to its inception. When I joined we had an idea what the backend would look like, how to join multiple STL files in the code but there was no usable graphical interface yet.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I interviewed stakeholders and users to create the vision  and requirements of the product for launch. Worked together with the developer to figure out steps to get there. When it was time to launch, I liaised with the marketing team to spread the word about the product. Read customer feedback and prioritised fixes and improvements. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    I wrote the handover document detailing technical information, an analysis of whatâ€™s good and what needs improving and a vision of the future of the project.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Overall I am very proud of this project. The Customizer has seen tens of thousands of downloads. This is the first commercial project I have managed almost from conception to launch.
